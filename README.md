# The River Avon
## Stratford-upon-Avon
Stratford-upon-Avon was chosen as a town of interest, in regards to the investigation of flooding, due to the local knowledge of the author. A plaque erected on the banks of the River Avon in Stratford-upon-Avon, nearby to the Royal Shakespear Company's main building, displays the vast heights the river has reached in the past, thereby heavily implying a historical problem with flooding within the town.

According to https://riverlevels.uk/river-avon-stratford-upon-avon-stratford, the most recent high recorded at the Stratford-upon-Avon gauging station was 1.89m on Monday the 26th of November 2012 and so it is this specific flood that will be investigated.

### Flooding Data

*Graph depicting the Avon's height during the months of November and December 2012, using data provided by the Environment Agency for the Cox's Yard guaging station located within Stratford-upon-Avon.*

The graph above clearly emphasizes two flooding events, one at the end of November (as expected from River Levels UK) but also another one at the end of December, most likely assisted by the ground already being waterlogged from the earlier November flood. To be thorough, it is now appropriate to find the FEV (as defined on the project homepage; https://github.com/Rivers-Project-2018/Group-Project) of each respective flooding event as opposed to simply hypothesising that because the November event has a higher maximum river height, a larger FEV is implied also. Both of the following graphs are plotted using the threshold height (the height at which the river began to flood) of 1.2 meters, as provided by the Environment Agency.

*The December 2012 flooding event.*

Hence it can be verified that, indeed, the November event resulted in a larger FEV. This FEV is particularly large (when compared with other FEV's calculated within the bounds of this project, more information on the other floods analyzed as part of this project can be found on the project homepage, listed above) not because of a large height or flow (indeed this river has a comparitively small threshold height and flow rate) but because this flooding event was prolonged over several days, whereas the majority of the other floods analyzed lasted less than a day. The FEV of the November event can be helpfully visualized by a "square lake", a lake of depth 2m with equal side-lengths, which are, in this case, 3868m each. This square lake, therefore, represents the same volume of the FEV, 21.56Mm^3
